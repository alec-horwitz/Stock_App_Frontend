# Stock_App_Frontend



This is frontend that I'm using as a side project to learn about the stock market and the basics of building graphs with D3. Eventually I plan to build a backend api to generate suggestions on what stock should be sold or bought. This backend will be intended as a way for me to learn how to make mechine learning algorithms with python and then learn how to make it into an api with django.


For more information on the planning phases of this project checkout my blog posts here:

Below are some screenshots of the wireframes I'm using to plan how the interface for the app will look on a mobile divice:
